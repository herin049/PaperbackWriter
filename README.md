# Project Overview #

PaperbackWriter is a project that [Taylor Sasser](https://github.com/TaylorSasser) and I started in August 2017 with the goal of further understanding how neural networks can be used to replicate the English lannguage. Furthermore, the creation of this project was made with the intent of making neural network code that was lightweight, efficient and intuitive.
